RapidEnv Example Java EE
========================

This is an example of a Jave EE development environment
with JBoss, Maven and Eclipse that demonstrates the power
of automated installation, configuration and update by RapidEnv.


Highlights:
-----------

* based on one single configuration file (environment/env.xml, size < 50 kB)
  the small but powerful Java tool RapidEnv (size < 5 MB) helps you to install
  and set up a complex development einvironment (size around 1000 MB) without
  any or with only a few user interactions.

* development environment specific operating system environment variables
  are controlled completely locally without polluting the global environment.

* Desktop and start menu icons are provided to start and stop or launch
  the components of the development environment.


Software installed:
-------------------

The RapidEnv environement setup and maintenance tool will set up
a standard development environment consisting in the following
software:
- jdk      Java SE Development Kit (including Java Runtime Environment)
           version 1.6.0_26 (upgrade to 1.7.0_2)
- maven    Maven build system
           version 3.0.3
- jboss    JBoss Application Server
           version 6.0.0.Final, (upgrade to 7.0.2.Final)
- eclipse  Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers SR2
           version 3.6.2 / Helios SR2, 3.7.1 (upgrade to 3.7.1 / Indigo SR1)
  - plugin jbosstools   JBoss integration into Eclipse
                        Version 3.2.0.GA.aggregate-Update-2011-02-16_18-30-44-H329


System Requirements:
--------------------

2 GB of Space on your harddiskhttps://github.com/downloads/bluemel/RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/RapidEnvExampleJavaEE-0.9.1.zip

RapidEnv currently basically works under Windows and Linux.
It has been tested so far with:
- Windows XP
- OpenSUSE Linux 11.4

A Java Runtime Environment (Version 1.6.x) has to be
installed in order to run the RapidEnv command line tool "renv".


Download and install the example:
---------------------------------

The GIT way:

  If you have installed the GIT version controly system you

- Open a Windows command prompt or Unix terminal window and
  go to the folder where you want the example to be installed

- type command
  git clone git@github.com:bluemel/RapidEnv.git

Without version control:

   Simply download and unpack example archive

Use Cases:
----------

  - Preparation:

    Unfortunately caused by Oracle's strict download policies I had mixed expierences
    trying to automate the JDK installer download (sometimes it worked but very often not).
    So in order to work quickly through the rest of the examples I propose to download the
    two JDKs used here manually.

    - JDK 1.6.0_30
      Download web site:
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u30-download-1377139.html
      File
        Windows x86, 32 bits: jdk-6u30-windows-i586.exe
        Linux x86, 32 bits:   jdk-6u30-linux-i586.bin
      Local folder:
        RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/toolsrepo/jdk/1.6.0_30

    - JDK 1.7.0_2
      Download web site:
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u30-download-1377139.html
      File
        Windows x86, 32 bits: jdk-7u2-windows-i586.exe
        Linux x86, 32 bits:   jdk-7u2-linux-i586.bin
      Local folder:
        RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/toolsrepo/jdk/1.7.0_2


  1) Use Case: Setup
     Initial development environment setup
     ----------------------------------------

  - Open a Windows command prompt or Unix terminal window
    in folder RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/bin

  - start RapidEnv by entering command:
    - Windows> renv -yes
    - Linux>   . renv -yes
      Prepending . on Linux is essential to influence the
      environment settings of the current shell window.

    This will install the development environment without
    any user interaction in 15 - 30 minutes depending of the
    speed of your internet connection and harddisk.

    On Linux typing the root user's password once might be
    necessary after 1 to 2 minutes because the JDK installation
    requires root user rights.

    Please note: if you did not download the JDK installers
    beforehand RapidEnv will stop the download procedure
    open a Browser and ask you to download the JDK installer(s)
    manually. In this case you simple continue the environment
    set up after successfull download by typing: renv -yes

  Watch the results:

    * Development environment specific command prompt / terminal window:
      Under Windows your Windows Explorer context menu now contains
      a menu entry "RapidEnv_RapidEnvExampleJavaEE_main".
      Using this menuy entry you can open a specif command prompt / terminal window
      "RapidEnv_RapidEnvExampleJavaEE main Command Prompt".
      This command prompt automatically has set up the specific environment
      variables for the example project (e. g. JAVA_HOME is now set
      to the appropriate Java installation folder).

    * Output of renv command:
      Whenever you type the "renv" command (which is now automatically
      in your current command path) you will see the properties and installation
      units of your development environment. The end of the renv command's
      output should look like this:
        ...
        Install units:
          = jdk 1.6.0_30
          = maven 3.0.3
          = jboss 6.0.0.Final
          = eclipse 3.6.2
          = eclipse/jbosstools 3.2.0.GA.aggregate-Update-2011-02-16_18-30-44-H329

    * JDK 1.6.0_30:
      Type command "java -version" in order to verify the correct environment set up.
      Expected output:
        java version "1.6.0_30"
        ...

    * Maven 3.0.3:
      Type command "mvn -version" in order to verify the correct environment set up.
      Expected output:
        Apache Maven 3.0.3 (r1075438; 2011-02-28 18:31:09+0100)
        Maven home: <root folder>\RapidEnvExampleJavaEE\tools\maven\3.0.3
        ...

    * JBoss 6.0.0.Final "Neo":
      For JBoss we configured an extra start command "jboss_start" wich will start
      JBoss with an extra associated terminal window. After JBoss has started up
      successfully it should print out a message similar to the following one:
      JBossAS [6.0.0.Final "Neo"] Started in 22s:953m
      Command "jboss_stop" will shut down JBoss and close the associated terminal window.

    * Desktop and start menu icons:
      After successfull installation of the develpment environment your desktop
      should contain the following desktop / start menu icons:
      - RapidEnv Example JEE JBoss start main: starts JBoss with a terminal output window
      - RapidEnv Example JEE JBoss stop main: stops JBoss
      - RapidEnv Example JEE Eclipse main: starts Eclipse
      Under Windows you'll find the same shortcuts also under the start menu.

    * Eclipse with configured JBoss integration (JBoss Tools plugin):
      Once you've started Eclipse using the specific desktop icon you will
      discover specfic tool bar icons coming from the JBoss Tools plugin.
      Using icon "Start JBoss 6.0 Runtime Server" you can start JBoss while
      the server process will write its output into the Eclipse COnsole view.
      Please try also the associated "Shutdown ..." toolbar icon.


  2) Use Case: Upgrade 
     Version upgrade of different parts of the development envrionment
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

   Basically in order to upgrade the components of your development environment
   to new versions you have to
   - change some settings in your environment configuration file
   - execute the RapidEnv update command

   in order to ease the changing of the environment configuration settings
   I've prepared some files:
   - RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/env_7.xml
   - RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/config/eclipse/runtimes_7.xml
   - RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/config/eclipse/servers_7.xml

   - Open development environment specific Windows command prompt
    or Unix terminal window using
    - Windows Explorex context menu entry
    - or KDE Dolphin "Actions" menu entry
    - or Gnome Nautilus "Scripts" menu entry
      "RapidEnvJavaEE Command Prompt main"

  - activate the new configuration by exectuing:
    Windows> cd RapidEnvExampleJavaEE\environment\config
    Windows> setEnvConfig7.cmd

  - start RapidEnv by entering command:
    - Windows> renv update
    - Linux>   . renv update

  Watch the results:

    * Output of renv command:
      Whenever you type the "renv" command (which is now automatically
      in your current command path) you will see the properties and installation
      units of your development environment. The end of the renv command's
      output should look like this:
        ...
        Install units:
          = jdk 1.7.0_2
          = maven 3.0.4
          = jboss 7.0.2.Final
          = eclipse 3.7.1
          = eclipse/jbosstools 3.3.0.M5.aggregate-Update-2011-12-14_19-42-13-H61

    * JDK 1.7.0_2:
      Type command "java -version" in order to verify the correct environment set up.
      Expected output:
        java version "1.7.0_2"
        ...

    * Maven 3.0.4:
      Type command "mvn -version" in order to verify the correct environment set up.
      Expected output:
        Apache Maven 3.0.4 (???)
        Maven home: <root folder>\RapidEnvExampleJavaEE\tools\maven\3.0.4
        ...

    * JBoss 7.0.2.Final "Arc":
      For JBoss we configured an extra start command "jboss_start" wich will start
      JBoss with an extra associated terminal window. After JBoss has started up
      successfully it should print out a message similar to the following one:
      JBossAS [7.0.2.Final "Arc"] Started in 10s:999m
      Command "jboss_stop" will shut down JBoss and close the associated terminal window.

    * Desktop and start menu icons:
      Will still work like before

    * Eclipse with configured JBoss integration (JBoss Tools plugin):
      Using icon "Start JBoss 7.0 Runtime Server" you can start JBoss while
      the server process will write its output into the Eclipse COnsole view.
      Please try also the associated "Shutdown ..." toolbar icon.


  3) Teardown
     Removal of the complete development environment
     -----------------------------------------------

  - Open development environment specific Windows command prompt
    or Unix terminal window using
    - Windows Explorer context menu entry
      "RapidEnvJavaEE Command Prompt main"
    - Linux KDE Dolphin "Actions" menu entry
      "Open Terminal RapidEnvJavaEE main"
    - Linux Gnome Nautilus "Scripts" menu entry
      "Open Terminal RapidEnvJavaEE main"

  - start RapidEnv by entering command:
    - Windows> renv deinstall
    - Linux>   . renv deinstall

  - remove folder RapidEnvExampleJavaEE from the
    file system.

  Celebrate:
    * your development environment has completely been
      wiped out without any trace left including
      file manager, desktop and start menu entries.
