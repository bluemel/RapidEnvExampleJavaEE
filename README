RapidEnv Example Java EE
========================

This is an example environment for a Jave EE development environment
with JBoss, Maven and Eclipse.

Highlights:

* out of one single configuration file (environment/env.xml, size < 50 kB)
  a small but poweful Java tool (size < 5 MB) you get installed and set
  up a complex development einvironment (size around 1000 MB) without
  any or with only a few user interactions in about half an hour.

* development environment specific operating system environment variables
  are controlled completely locally without polluting the global environment.

* Desktop and start menu icons are provided to start and stop or launch
  the components of the development environment.

* Due to the strict separation it is easily possible to have more
  than one development environmen of
  - different development projects
  - different branches of one and the same development project
  without severe side effects between them.

The RapidEnv environement setup and maintenance tool will set up
a standard development environment consisting in the following
