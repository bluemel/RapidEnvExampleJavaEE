RapidEnv Example Java EE
========================

This is an example environment for a Jave EE development environment
with JBoss, Maven and Eclipse.

Highlights:

* out of one single configuration file (environment/env.xml, size < 50 kB)
  a small but powerful Java tool (size < 5 MB) helps you to install and set
  up a complex development einvironment (size around 1000 MB) without
  any or with only a few user interactions in about half an hour.

* development environment specific operating system environment variables
  are controlled completely locally without polluting the global environment.

* Desktop and start menu icons are provided to start and stop or launch
  the components of the development environment.

* Due to the strict separation it is easily possible to have more
  than one development environment of
  - different development projects
  - different branches of one and the same development project
  on one and the same machine without severe side effects or encroachment
  between them.

The RapidEnv environement setup and maintenance tool will set up
a standard development environment consisting in the following

System Requirements:
====================

2 GB of Space on your harddisk

RapidEnv currently basically works under Windows and Linux.
It has been tested so far with:
- Windows XP
- OpenSUSE Linux 11.4

A Java Runtime Environment (Version 1.6.x) has to be
installed in order to run the RapidEnv command line tool "renv".


To do:
======

- Open a Windows command prompt or Unix shell or terminal window
  in folder RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/bin

- start RapidEnv by entering command:

  - Windows> renv -yes

  - Linux>   . renv -yes
             Prepending . is essential to influence the
             environment settings of the current shell window.

    On Linux additional interactions might be neccessary because
    the JDK installation / deinstallation requires root user
    rights.
