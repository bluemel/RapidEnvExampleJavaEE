RapidEnv Example Java EE
========================

This is an example environment for a Jave EE development environment
with JBoss, Maven and Eclipse that demonstrates the power of RapidEnv.


Highlights of RapidEnv:
-----------------------

* out of one single configuration file (environment/env.xml, size < 50 kB)
  the small but powerful Java tool RapidEnv (size < 5 MB) helps you to install
  and set up a complex development einvironment (size around 1000 MB) without
  any or with only a few user interactions.

* development environment specific operating system environment variables
  are controlled completely locally without polluting the global environment.

* Desktop and start menu icons are provided to start and stop or launch
  the components of the development environment.

-------------------

The RapidEnv environement setup and maintenance tool will set up
a standard development environment consisting in the following
software:

System Requirements:
--------------------

2 GB of Space on your harddiskhttps://github.com/downloads/bluemel/RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/RapidEnvExampleJavaEE-0.9.1.zip

RapidEnv currently basically works under Windows and Linux.
It has been tested so far with:
- Windows XP
- OpenSUSE Linux 11.4

A Java Runtime Environment (Version 1.6.x) has to be
installed in order to run the RapidEnv command line tool "renv".


Dowload and install the example:
--------------------------------

The GIT way:

  If you have installed the GIT version controly system you

- Open a Windows command prompt or Unix terminal window and
  go to the folder where you want the example to be installed

- type command
  git clone git@github.com:bluemel/RapidEnv.git


Without version control:

   Simply download and unpack example archive
   https://github.com/downloads/bluemel/RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/RapidEnvExampleJavaEE-0.9.1.zip


Use Cases:
----------

  1) Initial development environment setup
  ----------------------------------------

  - Open a Windows command prompt or Unix terminal window
    in folder RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/bin

  - start RapidEnv by entering command:
    - Windows> renv -yes
    - Linux>   . renv -yes
      Prepending . on Linux is essential to influence the
      environment settings of the current shell window.

    This will install the development environment without
    any user interaction in 15 - 30 minutes depending of the
    speed of your internet connection and harddisk.

    On Linux typing the root user's password once might be
    necessary after 1 to 2 minutes because the JDK installation
    requires root user rights.

  Celebrate:
    * Development environment specific command prompt
    * Output of renv command
    * Environment set
    * Start and stop command for jboss
    * Desktop and start menu icons
    * Eclipse with configured JBoss integration (JBoss Tools plugin)


  2) Version upgrade of different parts of the development envrionment
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  - edit environment configuration file
    RapidEnvExampleJavaEE/environment/env.xml

    - enter new version for install unit jdk

    - enter new version for install unit eclipse


  - Open development environment specific Windows command prompt
    or Unix terminal window using
    - Windows Explorex context menu entry
    - or KDE Dolphin "Actions" menu entry
    - or Gnome Nautilus "Scripts" menu entry
      "RapidEnvJavaEE Command Prompt main"

  - start RapidEnv by entering command:
    - Windows> renv update
    - Linux>   . renv update

  Celebrate:
    * Environment changed
    * New JBoss version
    * New Eclipse version


  3) Removal of the complete development environment
  --------------------------------------------------

  - Open development environment specific Windows command prompt
    or Unix terminal window using
    - Windows Explorex context menu entry
    - or KDE Dolphin "Actions" menu entry
    - or Gnome Nautilus "Scripts" menu entry
      "RapidEnvJavaEE Command Prompt main"

  - start RapidEnv by entering command:
    - Windows> renv deinstall
    - Linux>   . renv deinstall

  - remove folder RapidEnvExampleJavaEE

  Celebrate:
    * your development environment has completely been
      wiped out without any trace left including
      file manager, desktop and start menu entries.
